    "Hi there, I can't use your product problems contact form as the captcha\r\nwill never let me submit.\r\n\r\nI have been trying to submit an inquiry / problem with the product I bought\r\na few months ago. Please see below:\r\n\r\n\r\nI ordered some gin glasses from you guys off of amazon a couple months ago.\r\nThey've been great! I've been handwashing them and used only a handful of\r\ntimes when I noticed a huge crack in the base of one, which eventually\r\nsheered off and broke entirely. We've used only a few times, stored very\r\nsafely on their own shelf, and always hand washed, so I have no idea what\r\ncould have caused the break. Wondering if it's a manufacturing defect. I\r\ncan't submit photos on this web portal but lmk if that's useful.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you send a reply to isabelle.rossideleon@gmail.com please?\r\n",
    "Never heard of Kurgmen. It's an interesting dilemma - sending money to\r\nUkraine & support their defense instigates more aggression from Putin, who\r\nis a defensive actor (fears Ukraine in NATO).\r\n\r\nSending money to Israel, while supporting a regime that is brutal to the\r\nPalestinians*, *also mitigates violence by an aggressive, power hungry\r\nactor in Iran (even if by proxy) which would likely instigate regional war\r\nfor decades. A dominantly powerful Isreal is much less likely to commit\r\nacts of terror in the region and destabilize things further, leading to\r\nmore death.\r\n\r\nIt's an interesting study in human behavior to me. On the one hand, more\r\npeople are dying in Ukraine and conditions are worse than in Gaze, but\r\nnobody seems to care from a humanitarian perspective, likely because it's\r\nsame-ethnic-group violence and violence between two recognized states\r\nengaged in more conventional warfare. But when it's perceived that one\r\nparty is significantly more powerful than the other (Israel), then suddenly\r\nit's a much bigger / worse crime. It's all just perception. We're ok\r\nfunding rockets to blow up Russians but not Palestinians. Why? In both\r\ncases the ones we're blowing up are most likely innocent, so what\r\ndifference does it make.\r\n\r\nIn terms of mortal danger - I actually think Israel is in more mortal\r\ndanger than Ukraine by far. Hamas won't conquer them, but they & their\r\nallies also exist purely to drive Israel into extinction and exterminate\r\nevery Jew living in the middle east (they have declared this publically),\r\nwhereas Russia's move is more strategic / power grab, and Putin's intention\r\nis not genocide. Hamas also is just an associative arm of Iran. Israel is\r\nbeing attacked by them, by Hezbollah, and by Iran itself. If there were\r\nopenly declared warfare between Iran and Israel, then the perception of the\r\nsituation would be much different. That's effectively what's happening in\r\nreality, but it's hard to conventionally recognize.\r\n\r\nIn terms of blowback on us - yes, probably. We seem to never learn that\r\nlesson. But unfortunately there is blowback either way. If we sit around\r\nand let Israel get attacked constantly by terrorists, there is a different\r\nkind of blowback, maybe a worse one globally, for that behavior. So it's\r\nsort of lose lose. Shepherding peace is the only win condition, but even\r\nthen it's a nuanced condition that will be hard to achieve.\r\n\r\nRoughly the same number of Ukrainian civilians have died as in Gaza (30k),\r\nwhile ~400k soldiers have died in the war.\r\n30k civilians died *per year *in the Syrian war, which we didn't interfere\r\nin despite chemical weapons use on civilians. And the US was held\r\nresponsible for not engaging in that conflict as well, at the time (we are\r\nexpected to do good always).\r\nNo country in history would ever have been expected to do the *right*\r\nthing. This is a recent and emergent phenomena. I maintain the *right*\r\nthing is pretty hard to sus out. It's easy to say it's to not cause harm,\r\nbut what about harm prevention? What about long term casualties vs. short\r\nterm casualties? Not saying we're doing the right thing, but I've come to\r\npass little judgement on these things recently.\r\n",

    "Nic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- Forwarded message ---------\r\nFrom: Nicholas Baird <nebaird.sail@gmail.com>\r\nDate: Tue, Mar 19, 2024 at 10:23‚ÄØAM\r\nSubject:\r\nTo: Cole Smith <cole.s.smith1@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n\r\n*BUILDING STRONG RELATIONSHIPS*\r\n\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   *How should founders interact with investors?*\r\n\r\n   *High level advice: Don't be afraid to ask.*\r\n   - VCs get pretty good at saying no to requests from portfolio companies\r\n      (or they'll find another person on their team to help you\r\ninstead). A good\r\n      rule of thumb is to let an investor do the filtering on what's too much\r\n      work.\r\n      - That said, every investor has a different philosophy: some\r\n      investors are strictly seeking option value. For example, a Series A fund\r\n      may participate in a seed round just for the opportunity to make a future\r\n      investment. There are other funds that spray and pray (making lots of\r\n      investments, even without conviction). In this case, your investor may be\r\n      less engaged.\r\n      - SPC is a high conviction, high ownership fund. SPC only leads or\r\n      co-leads rounds, because the expectation is that once a partner makes an\r\n      investment, they treat themselves as a member of the founding\r\nteam. They‚Äôre\r\n      on board to serve and help you.\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   *What makes for a good relationship?*\r\n\r\n   The best investor-founder relationships are the ones where there's a\r\n   high degree of trust and frequent collaboration. Yes there's a power\r\n   dynamic between investors and founders; but after investment, investors\r\n   want to make their money work. As an investor, I want to be treated as a\r\n   member of the founding team. There's no such thing as asking too much, or\r\n   overloading me.\r\n\r\n   Your investor should know everything that's happening at the company,\r\n   and should know enough to jump in if they had to (even though they're not\r\n   involved in the day-to-day). Don't be worried about impressing them. Trust\r\n   and transparency first. The healthiest relationships have almost complete\r\n   transparency.\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   *How to know if your relationship has gone awry?*\r\n\r\n   If a founder always communicates that everything is roses, then an\r\n   investor knows that: 1) there is a lack of mutual trust; 2) the founder is\r\n   scared of the investor; or 3) the founder is not being honest with\r\n   themselves (i.e. avoiding the pain of reality). All of these are red flags.\r\n\r\n   On the flip side, a good investor should have your back. They‚Äôre part of\r\n   the company. If they‚Äôre not with you for the whole ride (the good and the\r\n   bad), they're not a true partner. You shouldn‚Äôt need to worry about sharing\r\n   the failures with them. The version of the company they present to the\r\n   world will be the version that they'd want presented if they were the\r\n   founders.\r\n\r\n   Here are some specific signs that an investor is not pulling weight:\r\n   - They‚Äôre not putting in time. Don‚Äôt expect an investor to drop\r\n      everything (they also have lives), but responses should not be\r\nseveral days\r\n      late‚Ä¶ You should expect normal email protocol.\r\n      - You never have conversations that feel high bandwidth. At some\r\n      point, you should be discussing core issues with your investor, not the\r\n      surface-level issues that every company needs to figure out. It's a good\r\n      sign if it feels like a collaborative relationship, with\r\nproblem-solving at\r\n      the earliest stages.\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   *If you think an investor's instincts are off, how/when to communicate\r\n   this?*\r\n\r\n   Immediately. Investors have a lot of ideas, and they are used to\r\n   spouting off. They need to go a mile wide and an inch deep; they're good at\r\n   pattern matching across industries. But the founder knows a lot more about\r\n   their own company. Post-funding, if you're the CEO, you almost have an\r\n   obligation to correct your investors‚Äô instincts.\r\n\r\n   The situation may be different pre-funding... But generally investors\r\n   respect founders who are comfortable pushing back, as long as they're\r\n   respectful. If a founder has a strong point of view about their own domain,\r\n   I respect their priors (even for domains that I think I know well). Even\r\n   today, when I meet a company in a space I've operated in, my default is\r\n   that all my information is old or out-dated. I enter with a point of view,\r\n   but I‚Äôm open to being shown otherwise. Investors who think they know more\r\n   than the startup are likely arrogant.\r\n\r\n   For an investor, a good philosophy is that if a founder has a strong\r\n   point of view, the default is that they're right (until you can prove that\r\n   they're wrong).\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   *How does the founder-investor relationship change over time?*\r\n\r\n   The most successful long-term relationships are ones with a human bond.\r\n   Where the founder and investor genuinely have an interest in each other‚Äôs\r\n   success (something that transcends the business value of success). You both\r\n   want the product to succeed, and you want the people involved to get some\r\n   reward. This doesn‚Äôt happen with every relationship.\r\n\r\n   Over the longer-term, you also develop a sense of the other person‚Äôs\r\n   strengths and weaknesses ‚Äî e.g. where they‚Äôre most effective. You‚Äôll know\r\n   when to reach out to each other for different problems or opportunities.\r\n   This is not always obvious *a priori*, especially when first making an\r\n   investment. It‚Äôs builds, based on the level of comfort in the relationship.\r\n\r\n*RELATIONSHIP MAINTENANCE*\r\n\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   *What‚Äôs the best way to share updates with investors?*\r\n\r\n   Good investors will read all the reports sent by portfolio companies,\r\n   and will even reply. Most updates have an ask, and investors will try to\r\n   chime and help.\r\n\r\n   Here are a few best practices:\r\n   - Use the same format each time, to maintain flow across updates.\r\n      - Bucket your content into what‚Äôs going well (i.e., where we‚Äôre\r\n      winning); what‚Äôs not going well (i.e. where we‚Äôre losing, where investors\r\n      can help); and some of your longer-term thinking.\r\n      - The longer-term thinking might spark ideas for investors -- e.g.\r\n      who should I make an intro to for this founder?\r\n      - Check out: Investor Updates\r\n      <https://www.notion.so/Investor-Updates-2cd51d1fa3ff4670adfab819d09c8a99?pvs=21>\r\n      for a template.\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   *How to prioritize the company‚Äôs needs over investor updates?*\r\n\r\n   Prioritizing day-to-day is more art than science. The tricky part about\r\n   being a CEO is the duality of having to deal with the thorniest/most\r\n   ambiguous stuff (if you‚Äôve hired well, other people will handle the more\r\n   straightforward stuff), while also being the fulcrum for the cadence of the\r\n   company (like leading all-hands, running board meetings, keeping the pulse).\r\n\r\n   You can‚Äôt afford to give up your role in setting and maintaining pace.\r\n   You have to take care of fires while keeping the overall structure in\r\n   place. There will always be issues that threaten your routines -- every\r\n   week. But you can‚Äôt let that disrupt the flow.\r\n\r\n   Some guidelines:\r\n   - Never cancel a board meeting.\r\n      - Never cancel an all-hands. There‚Äôs nothing more important than\r\n      communicating with your team.\r\n      - Never cancel a regular meeting with your executives.\r\n\r\n   It may be OK to cancel a 1:1 if you need to put out a fire. But there\r\n   are disciplines you need to keep. You need to balance short-term fires with\r\n   maintaining the company‚Äôs structure and cadence.\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   *What is something most founders obsess about, that turns out to not\r\n   matter that much?*\r\n\r\n   When it comes to relationships with investors, founders often obsess\r\n   about coming off as having everything under control, all the time. True\r\n   leadership means acknowledging what you don't know, and that the startup\r\n   journey is an experiment (with ebbs and flows). Investors who have been\r\n   operators will already understand this.\r\n\r\n   By the way, it's obvious when things are not going well. Don't put on a\r\n   brave face. It's healthier for you and the relationship to be honest.\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   *How do investors view internal conflicts, e.g. when there are strong\r\n   but divergent convictions within a company?*\r\n\r\n   Every company needs an individual responsible for big decisions. The\r\n   principle needs to be ‚Äú*we disagree, but commit*.‚Äù This could be CEO‚Äôs\r\n   role, but there always needs to be someone whose job is to make the final\r\n   decision.\r\n   - It‚Äôs poisonous for a company when people disagree but don‚Äôt commit;\r\n      then you get passive aggression and open conflict.\r\n      - Even when there are two co-founders, you always need the CEO to\r\n      make a decision and move on. You can‚Äôt keep pursuing consensus.\r\n\r\n   As an investor, no opinion should count more than the CEO‚Äôs. Investors\r\n   might provide capital and serve as advisors, but it‚Äôs not their company.\r\n   Investors can‚Äôt force the firm to wait before raising the next round, or\r\n   avoid a specific co-investor. They should support whatever the CEO decides.\r\n   Investors do have a voice, and they want to be listened to -- but the best\r\n   ones are humble, and just provide the advice.\r\n\r\n*COMMUNICATING PRE-INVESTMENT*\r\n\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   *How should founders approach investors with an investment opportunity?*\r\n\r\n   There is a different relationship between an entrepreneur and an\r\n   investor before a funding commitment is made. Before an investment,\r\n   investors want to hear from founders at most once per month. Honestly not\r\n   much happens in a month, no matter how quickly a company is moving.\r\n\r\n   Of course a good investor will never turn down an offer to get more\r\n   information; information is power. At the same time, there are three\r\n   problems with communication:\r\n   1. It takes time to digest information. When you haven't committed to\r\n      helping a company, getting too many updates can feel like overload.\r\n      2. It takes effort to process updates that are poorly written. This\r\n      can make it feel like the entrepreneur is lazy.\r\n      3. Too much communication comes across as desperate.\r\n\r\n   There are also entrepreneurs that try to get VCs to do work for them, as\r\n   a power play. But for everyone, the most precious commodity is time.\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   *At what stage should SPC members come talk to the SPC Fund?*\r\n\r\n   Once you join SPC, there‚Äôs a commitment we make to each other -- a\r\n   commitment to help out. With many of SPC‚Äôs investments in member companies,\r\n   the relationship between the fund partner and the company started well\r\n   before investment. One of the partners will have spent time brainstorming\r\n   and regularly jamming with the founders. SPC partners also play a role as\r\n   members of the community, giving feedback to others.

Ping @Arian Agrawal and @Evan Tana for details.\r\n\r\n   </aside>\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   *If you're getting pursued by an investor while at SPC, what's the best\r\n   way to interact?*\r\n\r\n   Regardless of the ‚Äúquality‚Äù of an investor, most good VCs will want you\r\n   to have a strong idea when they meet with you ‚Äî something that's worth\r\n   pursuing. So, chats with investors are the most interesting and useful when\r\n   you're focused on an idea and ready for feedback.\r\n   - You should be poised to discuss and ask about your target markets, and\r\n      whether they make sense.\r\n      - It's not crazy to meet for coffee earlier on, but if it's a\r\n      completely undirected conversation (and a low-strength connection), it's\r\n      easy to waste your time.\r\n\r\n   Also, the investors who are most anxious to get involved at the earliest\r\n   stages may not end up being strategic partners. Most ‚Äúgood‚Äù VCs are not\r\n   pursuing random outreach. They tend to be more directed and systematic,\r\n   especially if they‚Äôre a Series A/B firm. More venerable firms ask their\r\n   junior associates to learn by cutting small checks. But in this case, you\r\n   won't get much input from the senior partner at that firm.\r\n\r\n   A general note: capital for ventures is in abundance, and no good idea\r\n   will go unfunded. Don't feel anxiety about access to capital; worry about\r\n   whether what you‚Äôre working on is a good idea.\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   *How can you tell if you‚Äôve got investor-founder fit?*\r\n   - Remember, you are partnering not with the brand name of the firm, but\r\n      with the partner. This should be someone you can trust, because\r\nultimately\r\n      your interface to the firm is the partner. And it sucks if\r\nyou‚Äôre just one\r\n      of the 30 companies in a partner‚Äôs stack (especially if you‚Äôre at the\r\n      bottom of the pile).\r\n      - When you're selecting an investor: if you don't feel like you have\r\n      transparency, then you need to think twice. Find somebody you feel a\r\n      connection to, and someone who will spend time on your company.\r\n      - In addition to the sense of connection and transparency, consider\r\n      the partner‚Äôs relevant investing and/or operating experience in the area\r\n      that you‚Äôre building.\r\n      - What‚Äôs the investor‚Äôs slope in understanding your market? Are they\r\n      asking you meaningful questions that help inflect your\r\nunderstanding or are\r\n      they mostly surface-level questions?\r\n\r\n   As much as investors want you to think they‚Äôre the ‚Äúmake or break‚Äù,\r\n   ultimately it‚Äôs up to you. Investors can play a role, but you shouldn‚Äôt\r\n   need to spend time worrying what your investor thinks. You need to trust\r\n   that they‚Äôre on your team and will help out when you need it.\r\n\r\nNic\r\n",
    "Nic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- Forwarded message ---------\r\nFrom: Nicholas Baird <nebaird.sail@gmail.com>\r\nDate: Tue, Mar 19, 2024 at 10:14‚ÄØAM\r\nSubject: planning a raise\r\nTo: Cole Smith <cole.s.smith1@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n\r\nHigh-Level Thoughts\r\n\r\n   - *Commit to the process.* If you're going to fundraise, commit to it\r\n   and do it properly. You'll waste time and be ineffective if you are\r\n   haphazard or non-committal about your raise.\r\n   - *Fundraising requires a ton of time and energy.* You need to budget\r\n   for the productivity hit. Make sure one person takes the lead to limit the\r\n   distraction to your co-founders and teammates.\r\n   - *Run a tight and strategic process.* Be deliberate about how you\r\n   prioritize your investors and schedule them within a tight timeframe. Avoid\r\n   large time gaps between your conversations; otherwise, you risk losing\r\n   leverage and the ability to generate momentum.\r\n   - *Approach with an iterative mindset.* Every pitch is an opportunity to\r\n   understand what resonates and what doesn't. Make sure you reflect on what\r\n   can be improved and don't be afraid to iterate and experiment with your\r\n   pitch. (With that said, recognize that some investors simply won't get it\r\n   and aren't a fit. While you should iterate, don't over-rotate.)\r\n   - *Don't be afraid of \"getting to a no\".* Be prepared to be told \"no\"\r\n   many times in the process. A \"no\" helps you move on and prioritize your\r\n   other conversations. ‚ÄúIf you receive a no, ask for feedback and be okay if\r\n   they don‚Äôt respond. Every now and again, you‚Äôll get a gem that vastly\r\n   accelerates your learning.‚Äù\r\n   - *SPC is here to help you fundraise successfully.* Please engage us\r\n   early in the process so we can help you prepare the narrative and also help\r\n   accelerate your investor intros.\r\n\r\nChecklist for your Fundraise\r\n\r\n   - [ ] Pitch Deck\r\n   <https://www.notion.so/Building-a-Seed-Deck-08351b54592f431bb3ce11d5c8f87bdc?pvs=21>\r\n   - [ ] Blurb & Company Description\r\n   <https://www.notion.so/Blurb-Company-Description-7656b6d7b9924c75939cc0c49cbe67e0?pvs=21>\r\n   - [ ] Fundraise Timeline\r\n      - Avoid Thanksgiving through New Years (late November through early\r\n      January) and late summer (July and August)\r\n   - [ ] Intro List\r\n      - Who you plan to reach out to to help you fundraise\r\n         - Include anyone in your network you feel comfortable asking - you\r\n         never know who knows who\r\n         - Strategizing on how introductions are made is very important.\r\n         Portfolio company founders and SPC staff will be your\r\nstrongest channels\r\n         for intros.\r\n      - [ ] Investor List\r\n      - Create this spreadsheet\r\n      <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15dSMZvSPsFMjioz4-YhuovJe6ZiW9vqz0W31kbZXR1s/edit#gid=0>\r\n      of who you want to raise from and who will connect you to that person\r\n      - A good starting point to create this list is from the SPC Investor\r\n      Network\r\n      <https://www.notion.so/SPC-Investor-Network-7c3b340dde554d5f9c052edd14cda7aa?pvs=21>\r\n      - Prioritize the list (practice, Tier I and Tier 2)\r\n\r\nTypes of investors\r\n\r\nThere are many different types of investors you are going to pitch, the\r\nbelow will help you prioritize who you meet and when. Anchor on having some\r\nearly friendlier conversations to get warmed up. Schedule your larger fund\r\nconversations near one another.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, group potential investors into tiers 1 (your tier 1 will be\r\nyour target ideal investors) ,2, and 3 and reach out to 5-7 funds from tier\r\n2 to warm up before pitching tier 1 investors. This way you can hear\r\nfeedback and incorporate or pause to course-correct if there‚Äôs something\r\nweak.\r\n\r\n   1. Friends & Family: Small check sizes (under $25k), quick closings,\r\n   minimal effort.\r\n   2. Eager Angel Investors: Check sizes not important, focus on quick\r\n   investment and generating momentum.\r\n   3. Angel Investors with Domain Expertise: Check sizes not important,\r\n   look for quick movers and industry credibility.\r\n   4. Well-Respected Angels: Closing deals with these angels increases\r\n   credibility, preparation is key.\r\n   5. Seed Firms (aka \"Angel Firms\"): Seek firms with previous investments,\r\n   domain experts, and respected angels. Multiple meetings may be required.\r\n   6. Series A Multi-stage VC Firms: Mainly write Series A and B checks\r\n   ($5M+), variable policies on seed checks, low conversion rates. Some use\r\n   seed checks to buy an option into the Series A\r\n\r\nProposed Timeline 6-8 weeks before first investor pitch\r\n\r\n   1. Create a pitch outline.\r\n      1. The outline is fine as a written one-pager. (It‚Äôs better to start\r\n      with an outline to focus on the high-level narrative and content\r\nand avoid\r\n      getting slowed by deck design.)\r\n      2. Get feedback from the SPC staff on this early outline.\r\n   2. Create or update your shareable investor blurb\r\n   <https://www.notion.so/cf53787b04e949fc9764b6d308d10e89?pvs=21>.\r\n   3. Create your target investor list (you can copy this format\r\n   <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15dSMZvSPsFMjioz4-YhuovJe6ZiW9vqz0W31kbZXR1s/edit?usp=sharing>)\r\n\r\n      1. Include on this list people you think are your ideal investors\r\n      2. A good starting point to create this list is from the SPC Investor\r\n      Network\r\n      <https://www.notion.so/SPC-Investor-Network-7c3b340dde554d5f9c052edd14cda7aa?pvs=21>\r\n      3. Ask the SPC staff + other founders in SPC which other investors\r\n      they would be able to introduce you to.\r\n   4. Create spreadsheet or update your personal crm with everyone you plan\r\n   to notify that you are going out to raise and will need their help\r\n\r\n4-6 weeks before\r\n\r\n   1. Create your pitch deck\r\n   <https://www.notion.so/46e6ac8e6fab482ea5ae5f65d8ee7877?pvs=21>. We\r\n   recommend spending a bit of time and money on deck design. Great looking\r\n   slides go a long way!\r\n   2. Start outreach to friends and network to fill out your spreadsheet\r\n   <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15dSMZvSPsFMjioz4-YhuovJe6ZiW9vqz0W31kbZXR1s/edit?usp=sharing>\r\n   with who they can help you with intros to.\r\n      1. This spreadsheet will be public and shared with your friends and\r\n      close investors like SPC, *so do not use it to track notes* on your\r\n      meetings, create a separate CRM for you and your team only. Once you are\r\n      starting connections and tracking notes on who you meet with to follow up.\r\n      2. Keep your ask simple, clear and short. You want people to fill out\r\n      their name in the spreadsheet.\r\n         1. Sample ask: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going out to fundraise in a few weeks and\r\n         wanted to plan out the outreach strategy. I wanted to see if\r\nyou would be\r\n         comfortable making any introductions to any investors on this\r\nspreadsheet\r\n         attached. My ask is if you see someone on this list that you would be\r\n         comfortable introducing me to in a few weeks when I am ready,\r\nthat you list\r\n         your name in column E or F if you have a connection, and if\r\nyou think of\r\n         anyone else.‚Äù\r\n      3. Email your partner and cc investors@southparkcommons.com to get\r\n   their help filling out the spreadsheet of intros you are looking for.\r\n   Present your fundraising strategy and timeline in the email.\r\n   4. Engage with designer to take a pass on deck\r\n\r\n2-4 weeks before\r\n\r\n   1. Schedule a practice pitch with the SPC staff\r\n   2. Demo product and pitch within whole SPC community with your ask being\r\n   for intros to investors or customers\r\n   3. Queue up another 5 friendly investor-like people to get real feedback\r\n   on the pitch so that you go into the first round of meetings with more\r\n   confidence and experience\r\n   4. Iterate on feedback\r\n\r\n1-3 weeks before\r\n\r\n   1. Send out note to everyone that was willing to connect you and tell\r\n   them you are kicking off the raise and ask them to introduce you to the\r\n   people they agreed to. Include your blurb with the clear ask\r\n   <https://www.notion.so/cf53787b04e949fc9764b6d308d10e89?pvs=21>.\r\n   2. Begin to schedule meetings in person or over zoom for dates starting\r\n   the week you had planned to kick off based on intros as they come in.\r\n      - Investors love fomo, having a busy schedule of back to back\r\n      meetings over a condensed amount of time, increases the\r\nlikelihood that you\r\n      can drum it up.\r\n      - Try to reply within a few hours of being connected.\r\n   3. Create a CRM to track of all meetings and people and conversations so\r\n   you know who to follow up with and don‚Äôt forget anyone\r\n\r\nWeek before first meeting\r\n\r\n   1. Practice practice practice\r\n      1. Do it with friends, do it with each other, do with the SPC partners\r\n\r\nOnce the meetings are kicked off\r\n\r\n   1. Take notes on every meeting that you think is promising in your\r\n   private CRM tracker\r\n   2. Be responsive to investor emails afterwards\r\n\r\nAdditional Resources\r\n\r\n   - Asking for an intro\r\n      - Blurb & Company Description\r\n      <https://www.notion.so/Blurb-Company-Description-7656b6d7b9924c75939cc0c49cbe67e0?pvs=21>\r\n      - Intro Emails\r\n      <https://docs.google.com/document/d/10PDZ0MEKfsadE1bGtvsHnxoB1PRpzKaOZjAW8LVkQis/edit#>\r\n      - Elad Intro <https://blog.eladgil.com/p/how-to-ask-for-introduction>\r\n   - Pitch Deck\r\n      - ‚Ä£\r\n   - Fundraising advice\r\n      -\r\n      https://www.healthtechnerds.com/articles/community-wisdom-fundraising-at-the-seed-stage\r\n\r\nNic\r\n",
    "Hey Fabrice, just forwarding these via email so you can have them. Couldn't\r\nfind a way to share the Notion doc since it's restricted.\r\nNic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- Forwarded message ---------\r\nFrom: Nicholas Baird <nebaird.sail@gmail.com>\r\nDate: Tue, Mar 19, 2024 at 10:01‚ÄØAM\r\nSubject: Decks\r\nTo: Cole Smith <cole.s.smith1@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n\r\nDeck Template for Seed Fundraising\r\n\r\n*Aim to have around 8 primary slides. Many decks manage to succinctly\r\naddress each of these pitch topics with 1 slide per section, but sometimes\r\nyou may need additional supporting slides per section. We don‚Äôt recommend\r\nhaving more than 3 per section.*\r\n\r\n   1. *Title:* Introduce your company with its name, logo, and a concise\r\n   tagline of your elevator pitch. Think 7-10 word description, max.\r\n   2. *Problem:* Clearly articulate the pain points or importance of the\r\n   problem you are addressing for your target users. Provide context to\r\n   investors who may not be familiar with your industry. Demonstrate that this\r\n   is a problem shared by a lot of customers == big market. If you can also\r\n   indicate how much money customers may be wiling to pay, by comparing what\r\n   they are paying now or other analogous comps, that will strengthen this as\r\n   well. (We find you can hit on market size question here without needing an\r\n   entirely separate market size section.)\r\n   3. *Solution:* Describe how your product or service solves the problem\r\n   identified in the previous slide. Provide a demo or concrete screenshots.\r\n   Avoid buzzwords, marketing speak and abstract terms. Investors are usually\r\n   itching to understand what it is you‚Äôre building at this point.\r\n   4. *Insight:* Explain what‚Äôs driving the early traction. Share what is\r\n   special about the solution and what the core insights are. We typically do\r\n   not recommend competitor slides, but this is the slide to contrast yourself\r\n   to other solutions. Speak to what you get right that others get wrong.\r\n   5. *Traction:* Showcase the most convincing evidence that you have a\r\n   compelling solution to a hair-on-fire problem. Use graphs or data to\r\n   illustrate revenue growth, user/usage growth, LOIs or PoCs, or timelines of\r\n   achieved milestones and future plans.\r\n   6. *GTM Playbook:* Explain the early GTM. Who are your users? How are\r\n   you finding them? What‚Äôs your unfair advantage with targeting and acquiring\r\n   users? Instill confidence that this is repeatable and you know how to scale\r\n   this.\r\n   7. *Future:* What‚Äôs the big vision and how big can this get? Connect the\r\n   high-level dots for how you get from where this business and product are\r\n   today to that big vision.\r\n   8. *Team:* Highlight why your team is the best fit to build your\r\n   business. Convincingly answer the ‚ÄúWhy You?‚Äù. While you should emphasize\r\n   relevant expertise, education, work experience, or notable accomplishments\r\n   in this, don‚Äôt go overboard with data.\r\n      1. Logos are great if they‚Äôre impressive\r\n      2. When talking over this slide, you should mention how you know one\r\n      another\r\n\r\nThe above 8 topics are the must-haves and how we would recommend ordering\r\nyour pitch deck. Here are a few additional slides that you might include in\r\nthe pitch (or in your appendix).\r\n\r\n   - Market + Business Model: Present a bottom-up calculation of your\r\n   market size\r\n   <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SQB92bYV1VAcBGyw9DSi7P62SlTbTJDXchYAFfkYf4k/edit#>\r\n   along with the assumptions you've made. This slide also serves to explain\r\n   your business model and revenue generation strategies to investors.\r\n   [Depending on the nature of your business and how far along you are, you\r\n   might move this into the main slide deck.]\r\n   - Milestones + Use of Funds: Communicate the specific milestones you\r\n   plan to achieve with the funding you are seeking. Investors want to see\r\n   alignment between these milestones and future funding requirements.\r\n   - Why Now?: Explain the recent changes in the world that have created an\r\n   opportune environment for building your company, which may not have been\r\n   possible in previous years. These changes could be related to regulations,\r\n   technology advancements, shifting customer behaviors, or widespread\r\n   platform adoption.\r\n   - Sales process and sales economics: If you are a B2B company with\r\n   significant revenue, consider including a slide about your sales process\r\n   and relevant sales metrics such as average deal size.\r\n   - Customers: For B2B companies, showcase logos and relevant information\r\n   about your customers, particularly if they are well-known or recognizable.\r\n   - Customer case study: Walk through a successful B2B customer's\r\n   experience with your product or service, highlighting the positive impact\r\n   it had on their business.\r\n   - Engagement and retention: Provide statistics on user retention and\r\n   engagement, particularly for consumer-focused companies. This slide can be\r\n   included in an appendix if needed.\r\n   - Unit economics: If your business model involves high cost of goods\r\n   sold (COGS), such as labor marketplaces, hardware companies, or certain\r\n   fintech companies, include relevant information about your unit economics.\r\n\r\nNic\r\n",

It\r\nneeds a visual upgrade but the content is very relevant and packed with a\r\nlot of great info. Some of the homework each week references further\r\nreading in that handbook, so keep the link handy or consider downloading a\r\ncopy. Below you will find reminders for the topics we‚Äôll be covering\r\nthroughout the course.\r\n\r\n*Taking Treats Gently *\r\n\r\nThis can be done in a couple of ways.  I like to wait until puppy starts to\r\nuse their tongue - I wait for two licks, then release the food.  In a\r\nlittle while, puppy learns that using teeth only delays the cookie, so\r\nthey'll begin licking immediately!  Another method is described in your\r\nhandbook\r\n<https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_LzC4u0hwqvL0Qd6KKs5u2-r-XqcqL7W> on\r\npage 34.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Impulse Control - just the beginning!*\r\n\r\nPuppies need to learn to control their impulses, much in the way children\r\ndo - a little bit at a time!!!  We'll practice a short exercise we call\r\n\"skydiver\" to get you off in the right direction. Show puppy you've got a\r\ntreat, maybe give her one.  Then come down from above her head, starting\r\nabout 2-3' above, with another treat - if her paws come off the ground,\r\nimmediately remove the treat!  If her paws stay down, give it to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdjust the speed you come in with to help her be successful - quickly\r\ncoming down with the treat will be easier for her. The slower you move\r\ntowards her with the treat the harder it will be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce she‚Äôs good when coming straight down fairly slowly, begin to change\r\nthe angle of approach with the treat to provide alternative challenges.\r\n\r\nFor review you can have a look at pages 39 & 40, practicing \"skydiver\" on\r\npage 40.\r\n\r\n*Capturing behavior! *\r\n\r\nCapturing means you wait for \"it\" (choose anything you like that puppy may\r\noffer), to happen and then click when it does.   This helps us work on our\r\nclicker timing and mechanics right from the start.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you don‚Äôt have a clicker or prefer not to use one, substitute ‚Äúyip‚Äù\r\ninstead. Try and be consistent in your tone and keep the ‚Äúyip‚Äù short and\r\ncrisp!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe'll wait for our pups to offer something we like (a look towards us, or\r\nsome of you may choose a sit, down, or something else), and then click when\r\nthey do what we want.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOver a few minutes of practice, you will discover that your pup just keep\r\noffering more and more of what you clicked for! You‚Äôll barely get your pup\r\nto stop looking (or sitting) at you! So great!!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince \"you get what you click\" you'll see more of what you're clicking for\r\n- you're creating a pup who will work to figure out how to make you say\r\n\"yes\" as opposed to doing all his puppy things to which you would want to\r\nsay \"no\"!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust think of all the things you might say \"yes\" to throughout puppy's day\r\n- laying down, chewing his toy, walking with all four paws on the ground\r\n(vs. jumping up), etc. Catch him doing it right! for review, you could:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n¬∑       Read pages 28-30 in your handbook about using the clicker\r\n\r\n¬∑       Practice clicking your pup for looking at you in many different\r\nplaces\r\n\r\n¬∑       keep engaging your helpers to be your training coach - making sure\r\nyou \"click\" THEN move with the treat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Name game (see page 37 of your handbook).  *\r\n\r\nAfter you learn to click for something your pup happened to offer, we'll\r\nmove right away onto teaching our pups to orient towards us as soon as\r\ntheir name is called.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSay your puppy‚Äôs name only once, then click when she orients towards you\r\nand give her a treat. The objective is for her to learn that it pays to\r\nlook towards you when her name is called.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt first, it's good enough if she just turns her head in your direction. As\r\nshe gets good at the game, you can hold out for her to look upwards toward\r\nyour head, then later still for direct eye contact. A ton of repetition of\r\nthis game is a GREAT idea - it builds the foundation for all future\r\nbehavior, especially coming when called.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor homework, continue to play this game in increasingly more distracting\r\nenvironments. Be careful to time your click correctly - just as your pup\r\nbegins to orient towards you. Also remember to avoid the human tendency to\r\nrepeat his/her name. Just say it once!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you say puppy's name and she doesn't orient towards you, what can you\r\ndo? You can make all kinds of odd noises to help prompt them to look in\r\nyour direction, then \"click\" as soon as they do so!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs puppy begins to learn that hearing her name will be followed by a click\r\nif she turns your way, the amount of prompting (funny noises) you should\r\nneed will be less and less, and before you know it, they'll respond EVERY\r\ntime you say their name!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*\"Touch\"  *\r\n\r\nWe will work to teach your puppy to target your hand with their nose for a\r\n\"click\" then a treat!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis can be useful for moving your puppy to new places, as a greeting for\r\nnew people (touching a hand that's placed low can prevent jumping), to help\r\nshy dogs build confidence when meeting new people, and for an easy game to\r\nplay to get puppy focused and working with you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce puppy is really good at it, you can use \"touch\" to get puppy to come\r\nto you from increasing distances away (if it sounds like the beginning for\r\ncoming when called, you're on the right track!). The more you work on this,\r\nthe more you and puppy will love it - and you'll find endless uses for your\r\npuppy's great \"touch!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead page 36 to review this exercise and practice it everywhere!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Luring behavior! *\r\n\r\nWe'll also work on how to use a technique called lure/reward training.\r\nWe'll learn to lure our pup into a down position, or teach them a \"spin\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPutting the food on his/her nose and moving very slowly (pretend it's a\r\nmagnet - if you move too quickly the magnet will disconnect), you'll work\r\ngradually until your pup lays down. For some, this might mean having to\r\nlure and feed every inch until finally your pup will put elbows on the\r\nground. For others, you may need to lure your pups under your leg to get\r\nthem into position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey key to luring is to keep the pup with you, and release the food when\r\nyou get what you want (either in stages or for a full behavior).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt‚Äôs critical to get that food out of your hand as soon as you can! That\r\nway puppy doesn't wait for you to pull out food before they will get to\r\nwork, but instead will respond to your hand signals and *THEN* get a treat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor review:\r\n\r\n¬∑ read page 31 in your handbook\r\n\r\n¬∑ practice your \"down\", first lured, then with an empty hand signal in lots\r\nof locations (making sure to keep distractions low until puppy is really\r\ngood at it!)\r\n\r\n¬∑ ONLY add a word AFTER your puppy has MASTERED doing what you want for an\r\nempty hand signal. We‚Äôll cover adding cues in a later section.\r\n\r\n*Mouthing & Bite Inhibition*\r\n\r\nOur puppies are little biting machines!!!  What does it mean and what\r\nshould we do? There are two great pages in your handbook on this, and it‚Äôs\r\na topic that really needs full justice given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease visit pages 19 & 20 to review and implement the practices that will\r\nhelp your puppy gain good bite inhibition and stop biting at you in play!\r\n\r\n*Socialize, socialize, socialize!!! *\r\n\r\n\"Look at that\" is a great socialization game. You can use it when\r\nsocializing puppies to different sights - a shopping cart, stroller, person\r\nskateboarding or riding a bike, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ‚ÄúClick‚Äù when puppy notices ‚Äòthe person, dog, or thing‚Äô, THEN lure puppy‚Äôs\r\nnose back in your direction, and THEN feed what you were luring with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMake sure your lure stays on puppy‚Äôs nose as if it were a magnet - move\r\nslowly so the magnet stays attached!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, in addition to creating a great association with different things,\r\nyou‚Äôre also training puppy to look at something novel and check back in\r\nwith you automatically! We‚Äôre creating a great behavior pattern that helps\r\npuppy break focus away from things s/he might find unusual or distracting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a great game to play with your puppy when they see another dog on\r\nleash. It helps teach them to ignore other dogs on leash. Socialization\r\nwith a bonus!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor homework, get puppy out there and do some more!!! This should make up\r\nthe bulk of your time with puppy until they‚Äôre 16 or 18 weeks old. If you\r\nlike, visit pages 14-17 in your handbook for more socialization ideas and\r\ntips.  Just get out there and let your pup experience the world in a\r\npositive way (by pairing anything they notice with food - sounds, people,\r\nsmells).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt home, change things when puppy isn‚Äôt watching. Put them to bed in the\r\ncrate next to your bed and then place a chair upside down where it doesn‚Äôt‚Äô\r\nbelong! Move a big bin into the floor. Open an umbrella and place it in the\r\nkitchen. Use your imagination and let puppy discover, be surprised, and\r\nrecover from the changes in their environment. That is socialization!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso consider finding a great Spotify list or downloading a playlist of\r\nsocialization sounds. Play it at a very low level to begin with. Puppy\r\nshould take notice of it, then recover and go on as though they don‚Äôt care.\r\nKeep it at that level for a day or two, playing it for about 20 minutes\r\nthree times a day, then increase the volume ONLY SLIGHTLY, and repeat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPositive exposure is key; prevent fearfulness by making sure the sounds and\r\nsights they are weary of don't get too close or loud and feed them while\r\nthey look or hear. Gradually get closer, being careful not to push them too\r\nhard.  Every puppy needs to go at their own pace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour puppy also needs to learn to communicate with other puppies, so as\r\nthey mature they know how to appropriately interact with all canine\r\npersonalities, breeds and sizes. This can be a challenge for you and we\r\nstrongly encourage you to consider our puppy day school\r\n<https://www.sfpuppyprep.com/puppy-day-school/> to help with this aspect of\r\nsocialization and to lay the foundation for all of puppy‚Äôs training needs\r\nat the same time!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*More about Impulse Control: wait (at the door)*\r\n\r\nTeach your puppy to wait at the door, rather than launching through of his\r\nown inclination. Surprise ‚Äì another puppy impulse control exercise!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can work on this either by asking for a sit and then opening the door,\r\nor by just using the opening and closing of the door as environmental\r\nfeedback for puppy. Our personal preference is to let the door do the\r\ntalking for you, but you can use either method.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReview page 41 in your handbook\r\n<https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_LzC4u0hwqvL0Qd6KKs5u2-r-XqcqL7W> for\r\nmore help on this!\r\n\r\n*Impulse Control: jumping up or building confidence*\r\n\r\nThere‚Äôs never enough practice for this. Get your puppy super excited, then\r\nstop dead in your tracks and become very boring the moment they jump up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResume your excited behavior when those paws go back down and quickly go\r\ndown to puppy‚Äôs level to reinforce them for being ‚Äúfour-on-the-floor.‚Äù\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRemember to remove yourself quickly if puppy jumps up!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso remember that shy puppies shouldn't be pushed beyond their comfort\r\nzone ‚Äì if your excitement and arousal seems scary to them, use this\r\nexercise to build their confidence by only being a little excited, then\r\ntoss a few treats. Build up slowly to higher excitement levels until your\r\npuppy looks forward to your crazy dance!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Collar Grabs + Handling*\r\n\r\nThroughout the course of a dog‚Äôs life, there are many instances when we\r\nmight want to reach for (and hold onto) their collar. Some pups are\r\nnaturally shy about hands reaching towards them, while others have learned\r\nto run away because the main consequence to grabbing their collar has been\r\nan undesirable one from the puppy‚Äôs perspective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhichever the case, we can teach puppy that it is GOOD NEWS when we grab\r\nonto them, and this can help us in a very big way later on at the vet,\r\npossibly in an emergency, or just through the course of the day to either\r\nprevent or encourage certain behaviors (not the least of which is\r\nconnecting a leash).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n¬∑       Figure out where your puppy‚Äôs comfort level is with you reaching\r\nfor and grabbing their collar.  Do they shy away? If so, instead of a full\r\ncollar grab, just reach towards them as close as you can get but BEFORE\r\nthey feel the need to shy away. After several repetitions (at least 5-10),\r\nmove SLIGHTLY closer.  Repeat until you can grab their collar without puppy\r\nleaning away from you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n¬∑       Do at least 10 random collar grabs every day!  Try your best to\r\nhide the food so puppy doesn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs coming such that the collar grab\r\nis the ONLY predictor of the food. You can also use play for reinforcement\r\n‚Äì works really well with fetch or tug. Just grab the collar, pause, then\r\nrelease and start play!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n¬∑       All the same rules apply when teaching puppy to continue to be\r\ncomfortable with other body parts! Practice handling ears, paws, tail,\r\netc., using the same method and order of events!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Recall Beginnings (coming when called)*\r\n\r\nBe sure to read about the critical 5 keys to getting puppy to come when\r\ncalled reliably, on page 44 of your handbook. If you hold true to all of\r\nthose keys, your puppy will be able to have lots of freedom and exercise\r\nand of course, your amazing recall will impress everyone at the park!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe actually begin working on coming when called with the name game (see\r\nearlier section). If you can get your puppy to look at you when you say\r\ntheir name, then you've got the beginning of a fabulous recall!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext work on a ‚Äòback up recall‚Äô: calling puppy from further away but still\r\nwell within their capability ‚Äì no further than the other end of the leash.\r\nPractice only a few times, a few times a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs your puppy heads towards you, back up a little. It can also help to turn\r\naway from your puppy somewhat. Both of those strategies help to draw puppy\r\nin to you, making for a stronger recall. If your puppy is accepting of you\r\ngrabbing their collar, it‚Äôs time to start ending every recall with a collar\r\ngrab and *then* a treat party!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce you‚Äôve got a great ‚Äòback up‚Äô recall, it‚Äôs time to play some great\r\nindoor games that help with fun factor while teaching puppy that coming to\r\nyou when called is a brilliant idea! We‚Äôll play Hide and Seek, and another\r\nfun game we call FaceTime!\r\n\r\n*Recall Building Blocks (e.g. at the park)*\r\n\r\nIn addition to the great games we‚Äôve worked on, here are some things to\r\nconsider when you‚Äôre out and about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n¬∑       Choose the right moment to call your dog, and be sure to be close\r\nenough to guarantee success!\r\n\r\n¬∑       Decide when to call, and when to wait it out. Choosing the right\r\nmoment at this point in their development likely means waiting until puppy\r\nisn't engaged in much else (yes, it's a nano-second so you have to be ready\r\nfor it), and when they're fairly close by so it doesn't take much effort to\r\ncome your way. Then, when they arrive, you throw a treat and praise party,\r\nand maybe even play some tug!\r\n\r\n¬∑       If your puppy is enjoying play with another dog, at this stage it‚Äôs\r\nbest to get SUPER close and wait for a split second pause. Say your puppy‚Äôs\r\nname and then put a really GREAT treat in her mouth - even if she DIDN‚ÄôT\r\ngive you any sign she heard her name at all.\r\n\r\n¬∑       Repeat this frequently (10 times or more) within a brief period.\r\nWatch as she slowly catches on - that upon hearing her name she gets\r\nsomething FANTASTIC, and still gets to keep on playing!!\r\n\r\n¬∑       You get the picture - help her catch on, teach her she doesn‚Äôt\r\nloose play privileges, and a tiny bit at a time make it slightly harder,\r\nwaiting for her to come a step away from play to get the treat (and then\r\nlet her go right back again).\r\n\r\n¬∑       This forms the basis of a great recall, and as your puppy gets\r\nbetter, you‚Äôll notice that you‚Äôll say her name and she WILL begin to look\r\naround at you. Then it‚Äôs time to ask from a HALF STEP further away.\r\n\r\n¬∑       If you called and puppy didn't come to you, then you'll need to do\r\neverything you can to make it happen. Keep working on expanding your\r\ncheerleading vocabulary!  Any funny sounds that bring your pup towards you\r\nare free game! (Hint: higher pitched ones work better.) Of course, we don't\r\nwant to cheer-lead every time - only when it's going to be really hard for\r\npuppy to come but we've gone ahead and made the ask so must follow up!!!\r\n\r\n¬∑       It's critical to build success upon success with recall in such a\r\nway that your call always results in the right response - puppy coming to\r\nyou. Then, with hundreds of trials, one tiny bit at a time, recalls get\r\nharder.\r\n\r\n¬∑       It's such a gentle upward slope, puppy almost never fails and\r\nbefore you know it, you've got a stellar recall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Using Hand Signals & Verbal Cues*\r\n\r\nDogs really struggle to learn words for things you want from them. Just\r\nthink about how they must tune out the flood of language they hear from us\r\nall day long ‚Äì think Charlie Brown!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you do want your dog to ‚Äòtune in‚Äô to your word for something, here is\r\nthe very best way to help them learn. Let‚Äôs use teaching puppy to lie down\r\nwhen you say, ‚Äúdown‚Äù:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.    Make sure they know how lay down when you give them a hand signal\r\n(this should look similar to your lure, but with no food and it might also\r\nbe an attenuated (smaller) movement).\r\n\r\n2.    You should be at a stage where puppy doesn‚Äôt need food in your hand\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n3.    You should also be at a stage where your puppy goes down without\r\nreservation when you give the hand signal just once!\r\n\r\n4.    Once all of those things are true, now you‚Äôre ready to teach the word:\r\n\r\na.    Say ‚ÄúDown‚Äù in a happy tone.\r\n\r\nb.    PAUSE\r\n\r\nc.     Show hand signal\r\n\r\nd.    FEED a treat\r\n\r\ne.    REPEAT, REPEAT, REPEAT!\r\n\r\nf.     Make sure you‚Äôre only doing ONE step at a time: talk, THEN hand\r\nsignal, THEN treat!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPractice positions (sit, down, stand, and/or spin) with your puppy every\r\nday for only a couple of minutes at a time, maybe 3 times a day.  Chose\r\nonly one or two positions to work on during each session.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some skills, you probably have puppy responding some of the time when\r\nyou make a verbal request.  For other skills, you might be offering a hand\r\nsignal, or perhaps are still luring with food in your hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you‚Äôre at the stage of adding a verbal cue, just practice that one thing\r\nduring any particular session at first. This makes it easy for puppy to\r\nguess that word predicts your hand signal (and they‚Äôll learn more quickly\r\nto do what you‚Äôve asked before you‚Äôve even had a chance to get your hand\r\nsignal out)!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWork at whatever stage you are at with your pup, specific to each\r\nposition. Remember to work quickly at removing that lure so puppy doesn‚Äôt\r\nbecome dependent upon seeing the food in order to be willing to work!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen try teaching a new trick, adhering to all of the steps above and see\r\nhow much faster your pup can learn a word! Work on fading out the use of\r\nlures in lieu of a hand signal. From there, gradually attenuate the\r\nmagnitude of your hand signal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce your hand signal is reasonable (e.g. you don't have to do a hand\r\nsignal that touches the ground for down, for example), then you can begin\r\nto add a verbal cue. Make it easier for your dog to learn by ensuring that\r\nyour verbal cue always PRECEDES your already reliable hand signal.\r\n\r\n*Loose Leash Walking*\r\n\r\nLet‚Äôs teach puppy to walk nicely on a leash!  If you do not already have\r\none, go get an anti-pull harness (several brands are available: sensation,\r\neasy walk, wonder walker).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA correct harness can help your dog from practicing pulling while you‚Äôre\r\nworking to train them to walk nicely!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA flat leash, no longer than 6‚Äô is the best choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo begin, start without a leash at all! First, create a great association\r\nfor your puppy sitting BESIDE you! This is a huge shift for your puppy who\r\nhas grown up receiving a ton of reinforcement for being in front of you\r\ninstead!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChoose a side and be consistent across family members if at all possible.\r\nIt‚Äôs easier for puppy to master one side first. You can train the other\r\nside later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond, lure puppy to your side and into a sit. Sounds simple, but it\r\nisn‚Äôt! It can help to use the hand that‚Äôs on the same side as your dog.\r\nHold several treats in your hand and once you get puppy positioned (sitting\r\nat your side), dole them out one at a time in rapid succession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, take one step forward, lure the sit quickly, and feed multiple times.\r\nWe‚Äôre creating anchors ‚Äì puppy sits to start and sits to finish, and we‚Äôll\r\ngradually increase the number of steps beside you in between the anchor\r\npoints!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce your pup is pretty into sitting beside you and waiting between treats,\r\ntry taking two steps, then luring the sit. Make sure you are feeding\r\nfrequently enough that your dog is eager to make it to the next ‚Äòstop‚Äô and\r\nthus stays with you in between!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you get really good, you can even try turning corners and getting your\r\npup to stay with you! You can also try pausing briefly after stopping to\r\nsee if your puppy will sit automatically without your lure!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Loose Leash Walking ‚Äì Red Light, Green Light*\r\n\r\nIf you haven't already, read about the exercise, \"red light/green light\" to\r\nbuild your leash walking success, on page 45 of your handbook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith ‚ÄúRed Light/Green Light‚Äù, there are two main keys to success: 1) keep\r\nyour leash arm anchored to your body so there won't be any play in the\r\nleash (putting your hand in your pocket might be an easy way to prevent\r\nthis); and, 2) watch for slack and tension in the leash as close to where\r\nit connects to the collar/harness as possible ‚Äì that way your timing will\r\nbe accurate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you put your hand in your pocket, be careful not to lose your balance or\r\nfall ‚Äì not recommended if you have a big dog who could pull you over!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGO when the leash is slack and STOP the moment it‚Äôs taught. Your dog earns\r\nthe ‚ÄúGO‚Äù by making sure he releases the tension in the lead. Any way he\r\naccomplishes that is far game! He might lay down. He might sit. He might\r\nback up. Whichever way he does it, let him WIN immediately by moving\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you‚Äôre using food on the floor to practice, let him have it! Or let him\r\nsniff the tree. Or greet the person. Or get the toy! There are all kinds of\r\nopportunities to practice this, you just have to train yourself to stop\r\ndead when you feel tension ‚Äì EVERY TIME it happens. That way, it ultimately\r\nwon‚Äôt happen very often at all!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Resource Guarding Prevention*\r\n\r\nSome of you may have already noticed some resource guarding behavior in\r\nyour puppies.  They may have tried to keep something you wanted to take\r\naway, or rushed to consume their food or a chewie on approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt‚Äôs a completely natural and normal behavior on the part of your puppy,\r\nbut isn‚Äôt very practical in our human world, especially if they‚Äôre coveting\r\nthings from people (vs. from other dogs).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDogs will most often guard food, toys, water and/or people.  They may guard\r\nfrom people, and/or from other dogs. Signs they are guarding may include\r\nplaying keep away, freezing and glancing at you in their periphery,\r\naccelerated consumption, growling, snarling, snapping and of course, biting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are seeing significant signs of your puppy guarding from people,\r\nit‚Äôs a good idea to get advice and possibly have a trainer to work with you\r\nright away.  If you ignore early warning signs, guarding can escalate and\r\nbecome dangerous to you or your family and guests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can do a lot to help prevent puppy‚Äôs development of guarding behavior.\r\nHere are just a few examples:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n¬∑       Practice trading low value objects (or food) for high value objects\r\n(or food).  Puppy will learn to give things up easily if they think that\r\ndoing so will gain them something even more favorable.\r\n\r\n¬∑       Sharing is caring.  Puppy learns that they get the yummy bully\r\nstick, but only when you‚Äôre holding it (and you can practice trading it out\r\nfor steak, at the same time).\r\n\r\n¬∑       Adding high value yummies to food bowls.  Provided you have not\r\nseen any guarding in your pup thus far, you can add ‚Äúextras‚Äù to puppy‚Äôs\r\nbowl while they are eating.  This teaches them that a hand reaching into\r\ntheir food bowl is predictive of something great and not that you are a\r\nthreat to their current food source!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPractice all of the exercises to help puppy learn that hands towards him\r\nwhen he's got something very valuable is never a threat! You can read page\r\n48 in your handbook for review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Puppy Play: Be in the ‚Äòknow‚Äô*\r\n\r\nPuppy play is a little bit like going to a party - there will be some folks\r\none connects with right away, and other folks who aren't as easy to get to\r\nknow at first. There are different social styles, and some styles go\r\ntogether like peanut butter and jam, yet others more like water and oil\r\nover an open flame! This can change over time as learning happens and\r\npeople get to know one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo it is with puppy play, too! And, just like the guidance of good adult\r\nmentors of children, puppy owners can help their puppies learn good social\r\nskills, and help them cope in a world of differing personalities - and\r\nhugely different sizes!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt‚Äôs helpful to know what healthy dog play contains:\r\n\r\n¬∑       role reversals (i chase you, you chase me)\r\n\r\n¬∑       activity shifting (we chase, then wrestle, then break, move on to\r\nplay with a different pup, etc.)\r\n\r\n¬∑       frequent breaks - about every 3 seconds (even a quick pause in the\r\naction will do)\r\n\r\n¬∑       loose, wiggly body movements / relaxed postures\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt‚Äôs also good to know when it‚Äôs appropriate to interrupt your puppy by\r\ncalling their name, luring them away with food if necessary, or doing a\r\ncollar grab, then feeding:\r\n\r\n¬∑       if the above things are missing in play - one easy way to do this\r\nis to look and interrupt if any one thing goes on longer than 3 seconds\r\n\r\n¬∑       if you are concerned your puppy might be overwhelming another dog\r\n(perceived bully)\r\n\r\n¬∑       if you are concerned your puppy might be overwhelmed by another dog\r\n(perceived victim)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the last two, you can do a quick consent test to ascertain if either of\r\nthe two scenarios are at play.  Interrupt the perceived 'bully' and then\r\nwatch what the perceived 'victim' does.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe way to do this is to call the 'bully's' name and then keep their\r\nattention by feeding them. Watch to see what the 'victim' does. If the\r\nvictim moves away, you'll know s/he was being overwhelmed and in future,\r\ntry to interrupt slightly earlier. If the victim comes towards the 'bully'\r\nwanting to continue play, you'll know it was consensual and can let it\r\ncontinue, re-testing as needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe highly recommend giving your puppy some puppy-to-puppy socialization\r\nseveral times during their critical window of socialization. Our puppy day\r\nschool <https://www.sfpuppyprep.com/puppy-day-school/> can help you with\r\nthis if you don‚Äôt know enough different sizes, breeds and temperaments of\r\npuppies, or have a safe place to do it yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf done appropriately and enough times with many different puppies, your\r\npuppy will grow up to be more relaxed and confident when other dogs are\r\npresent. They‚Äôll know how to handle themselves at the party ‚Äì without\r\nrocking out of control or without experiencing fear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Want More?*\r\n\r\nAfter you‚Äôve earned your way to being a kindergarten graduate, you‚Äôll have\r\nsome solid foundational skills and a good understanding of how to build on\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nYou may be ready and able to fly on your own entirely from here!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor many, the structure and support of ongoing instruction helps maintain\r\nmomentum and ensures that you don‚Äôt stray too far from your goals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs your puppy matures, you‚Äôll likely find yourself scratching your head\r\nfrom time to time, wanting to make sure you‚Äôre on the right track, and also\r\nwanting to continue to challenge your puppy, who increasingly has more\r\nenergy and confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLuckily, we‚Äôve got just the thing! *200: Middle School*! Here is a sampling\r\nof what we‚Äôll cover at the next level:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n¬∑       *stay* in place\r\n\r\n¬∑       *stand* (think checking feet, vet exam, grooming)\r\n\r\n¬∑       learn to *groom with ease*\r\n\r\n¬∑       more *coming when called*: increasing challenge level with\r\ndistraction, distance\r\n\r\n¬∑       *leash walking*, greater distractions, alternatives and beginning\r\nto fade food\r\n\r\n¬∑       *leave it*, progressing to real life scenarios and higher value\r\nobjects\r\n\r\n¬∑       listening better: building a *dog who's truly listening* (cue\r\ndiscrimination)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Thank you*\r\n\r\nIt has been such a pleasure having you with us.

    "*BUILDING STRONG RELATIONSHIPS*\r\n\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   *How should founders interact with investors?*\r\n\r\n   *High level advice: Don't be afraid to ask.*\r\n   - VCs get pretty good at saying no to requests from portfolio companies\r\n      (or they'll find another person on their team to help you\r\ninstead). A good\r\n      rule of thumb is to let an investor do the filtering on what's too much\r\n      work.\r\n      - That said, every investor has a different philosophy: some\r\n      investors are strictly seeking option value. For example, a Series A fund\r\n      may participate in a seed round just for the opportunity to make a future\r\n      investment. There are other funds that spray and pray (making lots of\r\n      investments, even without conviction). In this case, your investor may be\r\n      less engaged.\r\n      - SPC is a high conviction, high ownership fund. SPC only leads or\r\n      co-leads rounds, because the expectation is that once a partner makes an\r\n      investment, they treat themselves as a member of the founding\r\nteam. They‚Äôre\r\n      on board to serve and help you.\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   *What makes for a good relationship?*\r\n\r\n   The best investor-founder relationships are the ones where there's a\r\n   high degree of trust and frequent collaboration. Yes there's a power\r\n   dynamic between investors and founders; but after investment, investors\r\n   want to make their money work. As an investor, I want to be treated as a\r\n   member of the founding team. There's no such thing as asking too much, or\r\n   overloading me.\r\n\r\n   Your investor should know everything that's happening at the company,\r\n   and should know enough to jump in if they had to (even though they're not\r\n   involved in the day-to-day). Don't be worried about impressing them. Trust\r\n   and transparency first. The healthiest relationships have almost complete\r\n   transparency.\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   *How to know if your relationship has gone awry?*\r\n\r\n   If a founder always communicates that everything is roses, then an\r\n   investor knows that: 1) there is a lack of mutual trust; 2) the founder is\r\n   scared of the investor; or 3) the founder is not being honest with\r\n   themselves (i.e. avoiding the pain of reality). All of these are red flags.\r\n\r\n   On the flip side, a good investor should have your back. They‚Äôre part of\r\n   the company. If they‚Äôre not with you for the whole ride (the good and the\r\n   bad), they're not a true partner. You shouldn‚Äôt need to worry about sharing\r\n   the failures with them. The version of the company they present to the\r\n   world will be the version that they'd want presented if they were the\r\n   founders.\r\n\r\n   Here are some specific signs that an investor is not pulling weight:\r\n   - They‚Äôre not putting in time. Don‚Äôt expect an investor to drop\r\n      everything (they also have lives), but responses should not be\r\nseveral days\r\n      late‚Ä¶ You should expect normal email protocol.\r\n      - You never have conversations that feel high bandwidth. At some\r\n      point, you should be discussing core issues with your investor, not the\r\n      surface-level issues that every company needs to figure out. It's a good\r\n      sign if it feels like a collaborative relationship, with\r\nproblem-solving at\r\n      the earliest stages.\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   *If you think an investor's instincts are off, how/when to communicate\r\n   this?*\r\n\r\n   Immediately. Investors have a lot of ideas, and they are used to\r\n   spouting off. They need to go a mile wide and an inch deep; they're good at\r\n   pattern matching across industries. But the founder knows a lot more about\r\n   their own company. Post-funding, if you're the CEO, you almost have an\r\n   obligation to correct your investors‚Äô instincts.\r\n\r\n   The situation may be different pre-funding... But generally investors\r\n   respect founders who are comfortable pushing back, as long as they're\r\n   respectful. If a founder has a strong point of view about their own domain,\r\n   I respect their priors (even for domains that I think I know well). Even\r\n   today, when I meet a company in a space I've operated in, my default is\r\n   that all my information is old or out-dated. I enter with a point of view,\r\n   but I‚Äôm open to being shown otherwise. Investors who think they know more\r\n   than the startup are likely arrogant.\r\n\r\n   For an investor, a good philosophy is that if a founder has a strong\r\n   point of view, the default is that they're right (until you can prove that\r\n   they're wrong).\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   *How does the founder-investor relationship change over time?*\r\n\r\n   The most successful long-term relationships are ones with a human bond.\r\n   Where the founder and investor genuinely have an interest in each other‚Äôs\r\n   success (something that transcends the business value of success). You both\r\n   want the product to succeed, and you want the people involved to get some\r\n   reward. This doesn‚Äôt happen with every relationship.\r\n\r\n   Over the longer-term, you also develop a sense of the other person‚Äôs\r\n   strengths and weaknesses ‚Äî e.g. where they‚Äôre most effective. You‚Äôll know\r\n   when to reach out to each other for different problems or opportunities.\r\n   This is not always obvious *a priori*, especially when first making an\r\n   investment. It‚Äôs builds, based on the level of comfort in the relationship.\r\n\r\n*RELATIONSHIP MAINTENANCE*\r\n\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   *What‚Äôs the best way to share updates with investors?*\r\n\r\n   Good investors will read all the reports sent by portfolio companies,\r\n   and will even reply. Most updates have an ask, and investors will try to\r\n   chime and help.\r\n\r\n   Here are a few best practices:\r\n   - Use the same format each time, to maintain flow across updates.\r\n      - Bucket your content into what‚Äôs going well (i.e., where we‚Äôre\r\n      winning); what‚Äôs not going well (i.e. where we‚Äôre losing, where investors\r\n      can help); and some of your longer-term thinking.\r\n      - The longer-term thinking might spark ideas for investors -- e.g.\r\n      who should I make an intro to for this founder?\r\n      - Check out: Investor Updates\r\n      <https://www.notion.so/Investor-Updates-2cd51d1fa3ff4670adfab819d09c8a99?pvs=21>\r\n      for a template.\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   *How to prioritize the company‚Äôs needs over investor updates?*\r\n\r\n   Prioritizing day-to-day is more art than science. The tricky part about\r\n   being a CEO is the duality of having to deal with the thorniest/most\r\n   ambiguous stuff (if you‚Äôve hired well, other people will handle the more\r\n   straightforward stuff), while also being the fulcrum for the cadence of the\r\n   company (like leading all-hands, running board meetings, keeping the pulse).\r\n\r\n   You can‚Äôt afford to give up your role in setting and maintaining pace.\r\n   You have to take care of fires while keeping the overall structure in\r\n   place. There will always be issues that threaten your routines -- every\r\n   week. But you can‚Äôt let that disrupt the flow.\r\n\r\n   Some guidelines:\r\n   - Never cancel a board meeting.\r\n      - Never cancel an all-hands. There‚Äôs nothing more important than\r\n      communicating with your team.\r\n      - Never cancel a regular meeting with your executives.\r\n\r\n   It may be OK to cancel a 1:1 if you need to put out a fire. But there\r\n   are disciplines you need to keep. You need to balance short-term fires with\r\n   maintaining the company‚Äôs structure and cadence.\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   *What is something most founders obsess about, that turns out to not\r\n   matter that much?*\r\n\r\n   When it comes to relationships with investors, founders often obsess\r\n   about coming off as having everything under control, all the time. True\r\n   leadership means acknowledging what you don't know, and that the startup\r\n   journey is an experiment (with ebbs and flows). Investors who have been\r\n   operators will already understand this.\r\n\r\n   By the way, it's obvious when things are not going well. Don't put on a\r\n   brave face. It's healthier for you and the relationship to be honest.\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   *How do investors view internal conflicts, e.g. when there are strong\r\n   but divergent convictions within a company?*\r\n\r\n   Every company needs an individual responsible for big decisions. The\r\n   principle needs to be ‚Äú*we disagree, but commit*.‚Äù This could be CEO‚Äôs\r\n   role, but there always needs to be someone whose job is to make the final\r\n   decision.\r\n   - It‚Äôs poisonous for a company when people disagree but don‚Äôt commit;\r\n      then you get passive aggression and open conflict.\r\n      - Even when there are two co-founders, you always need the CEO to\r\n      make a decision and move on. You can‚Äôt keep pursuing consensus.\r\n\r\n   As an investor, no opinion should count more than the CEO‚Äôs. Investors\r\n   might provide capital and serve as advisors, but it‚Äôs not their company.\r\n   Investors can‚Äôt force the firm to wait before raising the next round, or\r\n   avoid a specific co-investor. They should support whatever the CEO decides.\r\n   Investors do have a voice, and they want to be listened to -- but the best\r\n   ones are humble, and just provide the advice.\r\n\r\n*COMMUNICATING PRE-INVESTMENT*\r\n\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   *How should founders approach investors with an investment opportunity?*\r\n\r\n   There is a different relationship between an entrepreneur and an\r\n   investor before a funding commitment is made. Before an investment,\r\n   investors want to hear from founders at most once per month. Honestly not\r\n   much happens in a month, no matter how quickly a company is moving.\r\n\r\n   Of course a good investor will never turn down an offer to get more\r\n   information; information is power. At the same time, there are three\r\n   problems with communication:\r\n   1. It takes time to digest information. When you haven't committed to\r\n      helping a company, getting too many updates can feel like overload.\r\n      2. It takes effort to process updates that are poorly written. This\r\n      can make it feel like the entrepreneur is lazy.\r\n      3. Too much communication comes across as desperate.\r\n\r\n   There are also entrepreneurs that try to get VCs to do work for them, as\r\n   a power play. But for everyone, the most precious commodity is time.\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   *At what stage should SPC members come talk to the SPC Fund?*\r\n\r\n   Once you join SPC, there‚Äôs a commitment we make to each other -- a\r\n   commitment to help out. With many of SPC‚Äôs investments in member companies,\r\n   the relationship between the fund partner and the company started well\r\n   before investment. One of the partners will have spent time brainstorming\r\n   and regularly jamming with the founders. SPC partners also play a role as\r\n   members of the community, giving feedback to others. If one of us is\r\n   slammed, we might refer you to another partner. But members should err on\r\n   the side of hanging out, spending time, getting feedback.\r\n\r\n   <aside> üìñ Check out our fundraise resources:\r\n   <https://www.notion.so/aea9ff6d4d9e49f5a918d6c28130ad0c?pvs=21>\r\n\r\n   </aside>\r\n\r\n   <aside> üí° SPC Fund partners hold weekly office hours for members.

Ping @Arian Agrawal and @Evan Tana for details.\r\n\r\n   </aside>\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   *If you're getting pursued by an investor while at SPC, what's the best\r\n   way to interact?*\r\n\r\n   Regardless of the ‚Äúquality‚Äù of an investor, most good VCs will want you\r\n   to have a strong idea when they meet with you ‚Äî something that's worth\r\n   pursuing. So, chats with investors are the most interesting and useful when\r\n   you're focused on an idea and ready for feedback.\r\n   - You should be poised to discuss and ask about your target markets, and\r\n      whether they make sense.\r\n      - It's not crazy to meet for coffee earlier on, but if it's a\r\n      completely undirected conversation (and a low-strength connection), it's\r\n      easy to waste your time.\r\n\r\n   Also, the investors who are most anxious to get involved at the earliest\r\n   stages may not end up being strategic partners. Most ‚Äúgood‚Äù VCs are not\r\n   pursuing random outreach. They tend to be more directed and systematic,\r\n   especially if they‚Äôre a Series A/B firm. More venerable firms ask their\r\n   junior associates to learn by cutting small checks. But in this case, you\r\n   won't get much input from the senior partner at that firm.\r\n\r\n   A general note: capital for ventures is in abundance, and no good idea\r\n   will go unfunded. Don't feel anxiety about access to capital; worry about\r\n   whether what you‚Äôre working on is a good idea.\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   *How can you tell if you‚Äôve got investor-founder fit?*\r\n   - Remember, you are partnering not with the brand name of the firm, but\r\n      with the partner. This should be someone you can trust, because\r\nultimately\r\n      your interface to the firm is the partner. And it sucks if\r\nyou‚Äôre just one\r\n      of the 30 companies in a partner‚Äôs stack (especially if you‚Äôre at the\r\n      bottom of the pile).\r\n      - When you're selecting an investor: if you don't feel like you have\r\n      transparency, then you need to think twice. Find somebody you feel a\r\n      connection to, and someone who will spend time on your company.\r\n      - In addition to the sense of connection and transparency, consider\r\n      the partner‚Äôs relevant investing and/or operating experience in the area\r\n      that you‚Äôre building.\r\n      - What‚Äôs the investor‚Äôs slope in understanding your market? Are they\r\n      asking you meaningful questions that help inflect your\r\nunderstanding or are\r\n      they mostly surface-level questions?\r\n\r\n   As much as investors want you to think they‚Äôre the ‚Äúmake or break‚Äù,\r\n   ultimately it‚Äôs up to you. Investors can play a role, but you shouldn‚Äôt\r\n   need to spend time worrying what your investor thinks. You need to trust\r\n   that they‚Äôre on your team and will help out when you need it.\r\n\r\nNic\r\n",

    "High-Level Thoughts\r\n\r\n   - *Commit to the process.* If you're going to fundraise, commit to it\r\n   and do it properly. You'll waste time and be ineffective if you are\r\n   haphazard or non-committal about your raise.\r\n   - *Fundraising requires a ton of time and energy.* You need to budget\r\n   for the productivity hit. Make sure one person takes the lead to limit the\r\n   distraction to your co-founders and teammates.\r\n   - *Run a tight and strategic process.* Be deliberate about how you\r\n   prioritize your investors and schedule them within a tight timeframe. Avoid\r\n   large time gaps between your conversations; otherwise, you risk losing\r\n   leverage and the ability to generate momentum.\r\n   - *Approach with an iterative mindset.* Every pitch is an opportunity to\r\n   understand what resonates and what doesn't. Make sure you reflect on what\r\n   can be improved and don't be afraid to iterate and experiment with your\r\n   pitch. (With that said, recognize that some investors simply won't get it\r\n   and aren't a fit. While you should iterate, don't over-rotate.)\r\n   - *Don't be afraid of \"getting to a no\".* Be prepared to be told \"no\"\r\n   many times in the process. A \"no\" helps you move on and prioritize your\r\n   other conversations. ‚ÄúIf you receive a no, ask for feedback and be okay if\r\n   they don‚Äôt respond. Every now and again, you‚Äôll get a gem that vastly\r\n   accelerates your learning.‚Äù\r\n   - *SPC is here to help you fundraise successfully.* Please engage us\r\n   early in the process so we can help you prepare the narrative and also help\r\n   accelerate your investor intros.\r\n\r\nChecklist for your Fundraise\r\n\r\n   - [ ] Pitch Deck\r\n   <https://www.notion.so/Building-a-Seed-Deck-08351b54592f431bb3ce11d5c8f87bdc?pvs=21>\r\n   - [ ] Blurb & Company Description\r\n   <https://www.notion.so/Blurb-Company-Description-7656b6d7b9924c75939cc0c49cbe67e0?pvs=21>\r\n   - [ ] Fundraise Timeline\r\n      - Avoid Thanksgiving through New Years (late November through early\r\n      January) and late summer (July and August)\r\n   - [ ] Intro List\r\n      - Who you plan to reach out to to help you fundraise\r\n         - Include anyone in your network you feel comfortable asking - you\r\n         never know who knows who\r\n         - Strategizing on how introductions are made is very important.\r\n         Portfolio company founders and SPC staff will be your\r\nstrongest channels\r\n         for intros.\r\n      - [ ] Investor List\r\n      - Create this spreadsheet\r\n      <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15dSMZvSPsFMjioz4-YhuovJe6ZiW9vqz0W31kbZXR1s/edit#gid=0>\r\n      of who you want to raise from and who will connect you to that person\r\n      - A good starting point to create this list is from the SPC Investor\r\n      Network\r\n      <https://www.notion.so/SPC-Investor-Network-7c3b340dde554d5f9c052edd14cda7aa?pvs=21>\r\n      - Prioritize the list (practice, Tier I and Tier 2)\r\n\r\nTypes of investors\r\n\r\nThere are many different types of investors you are going to pitch, the\r\nbelow will help you prioritize who you meet and when. Anchor on having some\r\nearly friendlier conversations to get warmed up. Schedule your larger fund\r\nconversations near one another.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, group potential investors into tiers 1 (your tier 1 will be\r\nyour target ideal investors) ,2, and 3 and reach out to 5-7 funds from tier\r\n2 to warm up before pitching tier 1 investors. This way you can hear\r\nfeedback and incorporate or pause to course-correct if there‚Äôs something\r\nweak.\r\n\r\n   1. Friends & Family: Small check sizes (under $25k), quick closings,\r\n   minimal effort.\r\n   2. Eager Angel Investors: Check sizes not important, focus on quick\r\n   investment and generating momentum.\r\n   3. Angel Investors with Domain Expertise: Check sizes not important,\r\n   look for quick movers and industry credibility.\r\n   4. Well-Respected Angels: Closing deals with these angels increases\r\n   credibility, preparation is key.\r\n   5. Seed Firms (aka \"Angel Firms\"): Seek firms with previous investments,\r\n   domain experts, and respected angels. Multiple meetings may be required.\r\n   6. Series A Multi-stage VC Firms: Mainly write Series A and B checks\r\n   ($5M+), variable policies on seed checks, low conversion rates. Some use\r\n   seed checks to buy an option into the Series A\r\n\r\nProposed Timeline 6-8 weeks before first investor pitch\r\n\r\n   1. Create a pitch outline.\r\n      1. The outline is fine as a written one-pager. (It‚Äôs better to start\r\n      with an outline to focus on the high-level narrative and content\r\nand avoid\r\n      getting slowed by deck design.)\r\n      2. Get feedback from the SPC staff on this early outline.\r\n   2. Create or update your shareable investor blurb\r\n   <https://www.notion.so/cf53787b04e949fc9764b6d308d10e89?pvs=21>.\r\n   3. Create your target investor list (you can copy this format\r\n   <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15dSMZvSPsFMjioz4-YhuovJe6ZiW9vqz0W31kbZXR1s/edit?usp=sharing>)\r\n\r\n      1. Include on this list people you think are your ideal investors\r\n      2. A good starting point to create this list is from the SPC Investor\r\n      Network\r\n      <https://www.notion.so/SPC-Investor-Network-7c3b340dde554d5f9c052edd14cda7aa?pvs=21>\r\n      3. Ask the SPC staff + other founders in SPC which other investors\r\n      they would be able to introduce you to.\r\n   4. Create spreadsheet or update your personal crm with everyone you plan\r\n   to notify that you are going out to raise and will need their help\r\n\r\n4-6 weeks before\r\n\r\n   1. Create your pitch deck\r\n   <https://www.notion.so/46e6ac8e6fab482ea5ae5f65d8ee7877?pvs=21>. We\r\n   recommend spending a bit of time and money on deck design. Great looking\r\n   slides go a long way!\r\n   2. Start outreach to friends and network to fill out your spreadsheet\r\n   <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15dSMZvSPsFMjioz4-YhuovJe6ZiW9vqz0W31kbZXR1s/edit?usp=sharing>\r\n   with who they can help you with intros to.\r\n      1. This spreadsheet will be public and shared with your friends and\r\n      close investors like SPC, *so do not use it to track notes* on your\r\n      meetings, create a separate CRM for you and your team only. Once you are\r\n      starting connections and tracking notes on who you meet with to follow up.\r\n      2. Keep your ask simple, clear and short. You want people to fill out\r\n      their name in the spreadsheet.\r\n         1. Sample ask: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going out to fundraise in a few weeks and\r\n         wanted to plan out the outreach strategy. I wanted to see if\r\nyou would be\r\n         comfortable making any introductions to any investors on this\r\nspreadsheet\r\n         attached. My ask is if you see someone on this list that you would be\r\n         comfortable introducing me to in a few weeks when I am ready,\r\nthat you list\r\n         your name in column E or F if you have a connection, and if\r\nyou think of\r\n         anyone else.‚Äù\r\n      3. Email your partner and cc investors@southparkcommons.com to get\r\n   their help filling out the spreadsheet of intros you are looking for.\r\n   Present your fundraising strategy and timeline in the email.\r\n   4. Engage with designer to take a pass on deck\r\n\r\n2-4 weeks before\r\n\r\n   1. Schedule a practice pitch with the SPC staff\r\n   2. Demo product and pitch within whole SPC community with your ask being\r\n   for intros to investors or customers\r\n   3. Queue up another 5 friendly investor-like people to get real feedback\r\n   on the pitch so that you go into the first round of meetings with more\r\n   confidence and experience\r\n   4. Iterate on feedback\r\n\r\n1-3 weeks before\r\n\r\n   1. Send out note to everyone that was willing to connect you and tell\r\n   them you are kicking off the raise and ask them to introduce you to the\r\n   people they agreed to. Include your blurb with the clear ask\r\n   <https://www.notion.so/cf53787b04e949fc9764b6d308d10e89?pvs=21>.\r\n   2. Begin to schedule meetings in person or over zoom for dates starting\r\n   the week you had planned to kick off based on intros as they come in.\r\n      - Investors love fomo, having a busy schedule of back to back\r\n      meetings over a condensed amount of time, increases the\r\nlikelihood that you\r\n      can drum it up.\r\n      - Try to reply within a few hours of being connected.\r\n   3. Create a CRM to track of all meetings and people and conversations so\r\n   you know who to follow up with and don‚Äôt forget anyone\r\n\r\nWeek before first meeting\r\n\r\n   1. Practice practice practice\r\n      1. Do it with friends, do it with each other, do with the SPC partners\r\n\r\nOnce the meetings are kicked off\r\n\r\n   1. Take notes on every meeting that you think is promising in your\r\n   private CRM tracker\r\n   2.

    "Deck Template for Seed Fundraising\r\n\r\n*Aim to have around 8 primary slides. Many decks manage to succinctly\r\naddress each of these pitch topics with 1 slide per section, but sometimes\r\nyou may need additional supporting slides per section. We don‚Äôt recommend\r\nhaving more than 3 per section.*\r\n\r\n   1. *Title:* Introduce your company with its name, logo, and a concise\r\n   tagline of your elevator pitch. Think 7-10 word description, max.\r\n   2. *Problem:* Clearly articulate the pain points or importance of the\r\n   problem you are addressing for your target users. Provide context to\r\n   investors who may not be familiar with your industry. Demonstrate that this\r\n   is a problem shared by a lot of customers == big market. If you can also\r\n   indicate how much money customers may be wiling to pay, by comparing what\r\n   they are paying now or other analogous comps, that will strengthen this as\r\n   well. (We find you can hit on market size question here without needing an\r\n   entirely separate market size section.)\r\n   3. *Solution:* Describe how your product or service solves the problem\r\n   identified in the previous slide. Provide a demo or concrete screenshots.\r\n   Avoid buzzwords, marketing speak and abstract terms. Investors are usually\r\n   itching to understand what it is you‚Äôre building at this point.\r\n   4. *Insight:* Explain what‚Äôs driving the early traction. Share what is\r\n   special about the solution and what the core insights are. We typically do\r\n   not recommend competitor slides, but this is the slide to contrast yourself\r\n   to other solutions. Speak to what you get right that others get wrong.\r\n   5. *Traction:* Showcase the most convincing evidence that you have a\r\n   compelling solution to a hair-on-fire problem. Use graphs or data to\r\n   illustrate revenue growth, user/usage growth, LOIs or PoCs, or timelines of\r\n   achieved milestones and future plans.\r\n   6. *GTM Playbook:* Explain the early GTM. Who are your users? How are\r\n   you finding them? What‚Äôs your unfair advantage with targeting and acquiring\r\n   users? Instill confidence that this is repeatable and you know how to scale\r\n   this.\r\n   7. *Future:* What‚Äôs the big vision and how big can this get? Connect the\r\n   high-level dots for how you get from where this business and product are\r\n   today to that big vision.\r\n   8. *Team:* Highlight why your team is the best fit to build your\r\n   business. Convincingly answer the ‚ÄúWhy You?‚Äù. While you should emphasize\r\n   relevant expertise, education, work experience, or notable accomplishments\r\n   in this, don‚Äôt go overboard with data.\r\n      1. Logos are great if they‚Äôre impressive\r\n      2. When talking over this slide, you should mention how you know one\r\n      another\r\n\r\nThe above 8 topics are the must-haves and how we would recommend ordering\r\nyour pitch deck. Here are a few additional slides that you might include in\r\nthe pitch (or in your appendix).\r\n\r\n   - Market + Business Model: Present a bottom-up calculation of your\r\n   market size\r\n   <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SQB92bYV1VAcBGyw9DSi7P62SlTbTJDXchYAFfkYf4k/edit#>\r\n   along with the assumptions you've made. This slide also serves to explain\r\n   your business model and revenue generation strategies to investors.\r\n   [Depending on the nature of your business and how far along you are, you\r\n   might move this into the main slide deck.]\r\n   - Milestones + Use of Funds: Communicate the specific milestones you\r\n   plan to achieve with the funding you are seeking. Investors want to see\r\n   alignment between these milestones and future funding requirements.\r\n   - Why Now?: Explain the recent changes in the world that have created an\r\n   opportune environment for building your company, which may not have been\r\n   possible in previous years. These changes could be related to regulations,\r\n   technology advancements, shifting customer behaviors, or widespread\r\n   platform adoption.\r\n   - Sales process and sales economics: If you are a B2B company with\r\n   significant revenue, consider including a slide about your sales process\r\n   and relevant sales metrics such as average deal size.\r\n   - Customers: For B2B companies, showcase logos and relevant information\r\n   about your customers, particularly if they are well-known or recognizable.\r\n   - Customer case study: Walk through a successful B2B customer's\r\n   experience with your product or service, highlighting the positive impact\r\n   it had on their business.\r\n   - Engagement and retention: Provide statistics on user retention and\r\n   engagement, particularly for consumer-focused companies.

They allow faster optimization of\r\nLLMs by including many kinds of data that can be updated quickly.\r\n\r\nOther techniques for LLM optimization require retraining or fine-tuning.\r\nThese work, but take time. Standard LLM stacks of the (not-so-distant)\r\nfuture will leverage both RAG & fine-tuning.\r\n\r\nSuperlinked is now in product preview, working with several major\r\ninfrastructure partners like MongoDB, Redis, Dataiku, & others.

By this I mean, can any particular\r\ntheory be used to create a human adult level conscious machine. My bet is\r\non the late Gerald Edelman's Extended Theory of Neuronal Group Selection.\r\nThe lead group in robotics based on this theory is the Neurorobotics Lab at\r\nUC at Irvine. Dr. Edelman distinguished between primary consciousness,\r\nwhich came first in evolution, and that humans share with other conscious\r\nanimals, and higher order consciousness, which came to only humans with the\r\nacquisition of language. A machine with only primary consciousness will\r\nprobably have to come first.\r\n\r\nWhat I find special about the TNGS is the Darwin series of automata created\r\nat the Neurosciences Institute by Dr. Edelman and his colleagues in the\r\n1990's and 2000's. These machines perform in the real world, not in a\r\nrestricted simulated world, and display convincing physical behavior\r\nindicative of higher psychological functions necessary for consciousness,\r\nsuch as perceptual categorization, memory, and learning. They are based on\r\nrealistic models of the parts of the biological brain that the theory\r\nclaims subserve these functions. The extended TNGS allows for the emergence\r\nof consciousness based only on further evolutionary development of the\r\nbrain areas responsible for these functions, in a parsimonious way. No\r\nother research I've encountered is anywhere near as convincing.\r\n\r\nI post because on almost every video and article about the brain and\r\nconsciousness that I encounter, the attitude seems to be that we still know\r\nnext to nothing about how the brain and consciousness work; that there's\r\nlots of data but no unifying theory. I believe the extended TNGS is that\r\ntheory. My motivation is to keep that theory in front of the public. And\r\nobviously, I consider it the route to a truly conscious machine, primary\r\nand higher-order.\r\n\r\nMy advice to people who want to create a conscious machine is to seriously\r\nground themselves in the extended TNGS and the Darwin automata first, and\r\nproceed from there, by applying to Jeff Krichmar's lab at UC Irvine,\r\npossibly. Dr. Edelman's roadmap to a conscious machine is at\r\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10461\r\nView all responses\r\n<https://medium.com/@nebaird.sail/69c7f03b4c6b?responsesOpen=true&source=email-fcdcb0e1dfaf-1710777236608-activity.response_created-------------------------94592bea_6faa_4203_8e48_ea9c4509f7bc>\r\nAs the author, you can clap for this response to make it visible under your\r\nstory, so other readers can discover it.
