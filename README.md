# shinyagent
Just fucking around with some agent stuff
just testing around with some agent frameworks to do some networking for myself
It's very basic, the agent finds people and automatically sends messages.
In the future it will need to be trained on myself so it can speak for me and in a way that accurately represents myself. 
For now, I need LI data, basically, to compile a list of good candidates. I will manually screen those candidates and then have the agent send personalized messages to the people. 
I'll test this by having the agent send messages to a few friends first without prompting them, and see what they say to me. # shiny_agent
