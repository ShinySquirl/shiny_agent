working doc idea httpswwwnotionsoagenticnetworkingdaeadfcbccebbfpvs keep mind wip first thought bad idea people dont care networking realized networking underrated way advance oneself suspicion many people dont realize opportunity networks itll hard sus real problem dont think hard generate value users last weeks ive really thinking ideas could biggest impact humanity nobody else working deep dive hard sciences thought lot physics etc ultimately knowledge software currently one huge way generate value world unlocking ambition potential millions people value networking lost much population likely requires lot wasted time folks cant help someones current goals software help initial strategy would target folks already value networks highly vcs highnetworth individuals charge premium initially leverage networks build relationship strength moving forward truthfully failed cofounder sprints im feeling bit stuck frustrated want keep learning dont think im ready give yet even isnt perfect idea im going take shot give idea pivots wi space isabelle mentioned several times problem really committing one direction thats going focus time around action plan time around want really focus things matter give best chance raise simple plan going forward get cofounder p validate idea p build biz plan pitch deck p evangelize raise p build product p go market p im comfortable items seem failing recruiting cofounder dont exactly know ask group secrets know recruiting best people please share know anyone chat would open jamming together space please introduce us thank continued
